I'm super excited to open-source all of FeatureGuards code. The entire code is now available on
[Github](https://github.com/featureguards/platform).

## Why?

FeatureGuards was a fun side-project that I started. Initially, I built it as a side project to build
something from scratch using latest technologies and possibly run it as an bootstrapped business. I've
learnt a lot throughout the journey and decided to open-source the technology for everyone after discovering
similar product offerings in the market. I don't think the world needs yet another multi-tenant, secure, and
scalable feature-flagging system. But, anybody now can use the code as is to self-host it or even use
the platform I built for building any product they want. There is a lot of primitives built here that
can be leveraged to build any scalable web-service out of the box using the FeatureGuards stack.

# What's next?

I will be sunsetting FeatureGuards. The biggest takeaways are all the learnings and will be documenting
the architecture and design decisions on [Substack](https://brawi.substack.com). Follow me there to
get regular content on building FeatureGuards and other problems I've worked on over the years that I will
be talking about regularly.
