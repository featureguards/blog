# Why build yet another feature flag system?

Every company I worked for has built some version of a feature flag system with various degrees of
feature-sets, availability requirements and learnings. After joining my latest company, I decided
that it's time to build a feature flag system that is universally applicable to companies of all
sizes so nobody needs to re-invent the wheel. I'm extremely excited to start that journey. Our
roadmap is full of many exciting features. Stay tuned! In the meantime, give 
[FeatureGuards](https://www.featureguards.com) a try yourself and see it yourself.


# What is a feature flag?

Feature flags are ways to control how new features or code changes are rolled out. They're used
in various scenarios:


## Gradual Rollouts

Once the engineering team gets to a certain size, it becomes extremely likely for bugs to surface
during deployments causing the site or application to fail for almost every user, hence requiring
rollbacks and post-mortems. In one of my previous jobs, we couldn't release code for more than a
month because every time we release new code, it broke something different. Imagine you have 10s or
100s of engineers checking in code every day. It's just a matter of time before rollbacks start
creeping in.

One way to address this is by controlling the blast radius of code changes by doing something as
follows in your business logic:

```py
if is_on('NEW_EXPERIMENT', {'user_id': 1234}):
  # new logic
else:
  # existing logic
```

The main advantage here is that we can control the percentage of users where new logic will run for
and can ramp that up over time. Usually, you would start with 0%, ramp up the rollout, and monitor
the impact of the change by looking at relevant dashboards. The moment you observe new exceptions,
performance degradation, or error increase, then you would turn off the feature and continue
business as usual. Without a feature flag system, you would rollback the change. You can have
canary to minimize impact, but you don't have much control. There could be many code changes being
rolled out and sometimes it's hard to know what change caused what.

## Gating Features

It's quite common to enable or disable features based on some attribute associated with the user, 
company, location...etc. For example, a new feature is rolled out to a selected set of beta-test 
users, internal users, or some other set of IDs. Instead of adding an attribute on the user per
feature to be included/excluded, this can be delegated to a feature flag system where that mapping
is dynamic and can be updated on the fly (i.e., new beta test users).


## Kill Switch

In case of emergencies, it's sometimes better to have a degraded user experience than a full site
outage. So, it's useful to turn off certain features to reduce load on the backend. For example,
imagine a scenario where the database is overloaded. The load is coming let's say from unoptimized
queries that are associated with a particular feature (i.e., search). It's better to turn off search
temporarily to fix the issue as opposed to rendering the entire website unusable. Assuming the 
search feature code is gated by a feature flag, this can be easily done. In fact, it could be even
ramped down and not necessarily turned off immediately.



# Is it really complicated?

Like most problems in life, it's easy to build anything that *works*. It's much harder to build
something that works extremely well and all the time. One big characteristic that is needed for a
feature flag system is that its availability **must** be strictly better than the system using it.
Otherwise, it's not useful. So, building a system with 4 9s of availability or more isn't as simple
as it may seem. We will share more how we built [FeatureGuards](https://www.featureguards.com) with
that in mind. Stay tuned.

# What's next?

We're focused on building a world class feature flag system. Stay tuned for more.
